# My Project Plan

***Note:*** This document is written merely as an illustrative example, and does not provide  
any working guide to an actual project.

### Proposal

I am planning to make a computer vision software that detects objects in images.  
In order to build it, I will use OpenCV, deep learning libraries, such as [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=ko)  
or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), and other open source software.

For example, the objects in the following images were detected using [mmDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection):

### Dependencies

- Python
- opencv-python
- tensorflow
- openmmlab
- package manager

### Installation

In a bash terminal, run the following commands (**Do NOT actually run these commands in your computer**):

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ conda create -n cv_detection
$ conda activate cv_detection
$ python --version
$ python example.py
